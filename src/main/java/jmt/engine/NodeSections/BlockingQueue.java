/**
 * This class implements the queue of a region input station, that is

 *
 * @author Stefano Omini
 *
 * Modifief by Bertoli Marco 31-03-2006 (my birthday!!!) 
 * 
 * Modified by Ashanka (Oct 2009):
 * Desc: FCR(Finite Capacity Region) is a blocking region and it was measuring wrong 
 * 		 values for the Performance Indices. This was because the Jobs in FCR were not
 * 		 considering the time spent in the Queueing Stations in the FCR and simply reporting
 *       time spent in Queueing in FCR. This behavior is incorrect as Performance Indices for 
 *       FCR should also contain the time spent in the FCR and not only the time spent queueing.
 *       
 *       Approach taken presently to rectify is to delay the capture of the performance indices 
 *       until the job is out of the FCR. So the job dropping are manually handled for Blocking region
 *       at Node level.
