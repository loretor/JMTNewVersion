 * <p>Title: Measure Definition Interface</p>
 * <p>Description: This interface is implemented by each measure definition data structure. It is
 * provided to allow ResultsWindow not to be directly linked to underlying data structure, allowing
 * two or more different kind of result data structure. Actually it can be useful to have one
 * measure data structure that reads data from the engine and one that loads a saved file.</p>

 *              2. global throughput (Throughput per Sink)
 *              each sink per class.
