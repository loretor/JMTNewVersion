The model is closed, the workload consists of a single class of customers, the stations are two, one of them is of Load Dependent type (i.e., its service time depends on the number of customers in the station, usually referred to as queue length).

When defining service time (or service demand) for a LD station, one value of service time must be specified for each feasible population.
