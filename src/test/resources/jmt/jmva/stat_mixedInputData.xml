After solving the model, you may note that the utilization of delay center is greater than 1 (it is equal to the queue length - i.e., the mean number of customers in the station). 
This is not an error: utilization, may in fact be interpreted as the mean number of jobs in service. 
Delay centers are also called Infinite Servers, as they may serve all the present jobs at the same time.
Therefore, in the case of delay centers, utilization may be greater than 1.]]></description><parameters><classes number="3"><closedclass name="Class1" population="5"/><openclass name="Class2" rate="0.05"/><openclass name="Class3" rate="0.02"/></classes><stations number="3"><delaystation name="Station1"><servicetimes><servicetime customerclass="Class1">5.0</servicetime><servicetime customerclass="Class2">0.0</servicetime><servicetime customerclass="Class3">0.0</servicetime></servicetimes><visits><visit customerclass="Class1">1.0</visit><visit customerclass="Class2">0.0</visit><visit customerclass="Class3">0.0</visit></visits></delaystation><listation name="Station2" servers="1"><servicetimes><servicetime customerclass="Class1">1.0</servicetime><servicetime customerclass="Class2">1.1</servicetime><servicetime customerclass="Class3">1.1</servicetime></servicetimes><visits><visit customerclass="Class1">1.0</visit><visit customerclass="Class2">1.0</visit><visit customerclass="Class3">1.0</visit></visits></listation><listation name="Station3" servers="1"><servicetimes><servicetime customerclass="Class1">1.6</servicetime><servicetime customerclass="Class2">2.1</servicetime><servicetime customerclass="Class3">0.5</servicetime></servicetimes><visits><visit customerclass="Class1">1.0</visit><visit customerclass="Class2">1.0</visit><visit customerclass="Class3">1.0</visit></visits></listation></stations></parameters></model>
